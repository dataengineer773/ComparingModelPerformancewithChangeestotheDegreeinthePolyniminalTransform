More features may result in more overfitting and in turn worse results,It may be a good idea values for your dataset, in our project we can see that perofrmance is generally worse than no transform(degree 1)
expect for a degree3, it might be intersting to explore scaling the data before or after performing the transform ti how it impacts model performing, We can see that performance remain falt, perhaps with the
first overfitting with a degree of 4.
